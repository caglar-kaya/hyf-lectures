# Week-20 Q&A Session

## React Week1 Questions

Q1: While I was trying prep-exercise counter, why couldn't I import and use `setCount` function in `const [count, setCount] = useState(0)` inside another component although `setCount` is a function?

Q2: I wonder pros and cons between React.js, Angular.js, and Vue.js. Why do we prefer React.js?
